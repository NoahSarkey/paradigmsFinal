Description of Gameplay:
For our game, which began as tic tac toe, we have a few sets of directions:

1. To play a game of tic tac toe with somewhat suspect hovering colors, run
main.py; to play, simply click on the square you want to fill and the program
will automatically switch between players throughout the course of the game
until a winner is decided.

2. To play what will display our knowledge of Twisted and what we discussed
during office hours, run server.py followed by client.py; after doing this, we 
will begin on the Server window and you can move around and whatever square you
are on will be highlighted on both windows. If you click twice in the screen on
the same square, it will switch turns and allow the Client window ton control
the hovering (with a new color!). You can continually switch between the two 
windows with the double click. This is a fun and exciting game that we do not
yet know the name of yet but plan on marketing as "PyGame tag" where you can
never actually catch the square on the other window.

If you have any questions, please contact us at nsarkey@nd.edu or smustiph@nd.edu
and we will be happy to answer any questions.
